## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — Users schedule their Quora answers from the Appilot dashboard, specifying the content, time, and profile.
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot connects to the device or emulator using UI Automator or Appium, navigates to Quora, and prepares the answer for posting.
3. **Execution** — The automation posts the scheduled answers at the exact time, ensuring consistency.
4. **Feedback Loop** — Logging and analytics capture success or failure data for every post.
5. **Error Handling** — If an issue occurs, retry mechanisms and alerts are triggered automatically.
